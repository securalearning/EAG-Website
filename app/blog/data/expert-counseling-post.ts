      text: `Career counseling is more than just advice – it's a structured process designed to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their professional lives. It involves understanding your personality, interests, and aptitude to map out potential career paths. 

Whether you're a high school student unsure about what to study, a graduate exploring job options, or a professional seeking a career change, career counseling equips you with the tools and knowledge to navigate your journey confidently.

Without proper guidance, it's easy to feel overwhelmed and waste valuable time pursuing paths that may not suit you. Career counseling helps you avoid these pitfalls by providing clarity, direction, and actionable plans.`,
