      heading: "What Are Soft Skills and Why Are They Important?",
      text: `Soft skills refer to personal attributes that enable you to interact effectively and harmoniously with others. Unlike technical skills, which focus on specific tasks, soft skills are transferable and applicable across any industry or role. They include communication, teamwork, leadership, and adaptability.

In today's workplace, employers increasingly value soft skills as much as technical expertise. The ability to collaborate, solve problems, and manage time effectively can set you apart in a competitive job market.`,
